It covers the core concepts of machine learning, the history of ML, ML and fairness, regression ML techniques, classification ML techniques, clustering ML techniques, natural language processing ML techniques, time series forecasting ML techniques, reinforcement learning, and real-world applications for ML. The curriculum does not cover deep learning, neural networks, or AI. Machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery and has applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and weather prediction. Understanding the basics of machine learning is becoming essential across domains due to its widespread adoption.\"}\n",
      "{\"kb\": \"History of machine learning\", \"content\": \"Machine learning and artificial intelligence have a rich history that dates back to the 18th century. Notable discoveries such as Bayes Theorem, Least Square Theory, Markov Chains, and the invention of the Perceptron have shaped the field. The 1950s marked significant milestones with Alan Turing's concept of a 'machine that can think' and the Dartmouth Summer Research Project, which coined the term 'artificial intelligence'. The 'golden years' from the 1950s to 1970s saw optimism and advancements in natural language processing and intelligent systems. However, an 'AI Winter' in the 1970s led to a decline in funding and confidence. The 1980s witnessed the rise of expert systems, which combined business rules and inference engines. From 1993 to 2011, the field experienced a surge in data availability and computing power, leading to new advancements in ML and AI. Today, machine learning and AI have significant impacts on society and call for responsible development and regulation.\"}\n",
      "{\"kb\": \"# Techniques of Machine Learning\", \"content\": \"The process of building, using, and maintaining machine learning models and the data they use is a very different process from many other development workflows. In this lesson, we will demystify the process, and outline the main techniques you need to know. You will:\\n\\n- Understand the processes underpinning machine learning at a high level.\\n- Explore base concepts such as 'models', 'predictions', and 'training data'.\\n\\nThe lesson covers various steps in the machine learning process, including:\\n1. Deciding on a question\\n2. Collecting and preparing data\\n3. Choosing a training method\\n4. Training the model\\n5. Evaluating the model\\n6. Parameter tuning\\n7. Making predictions\\n\\nThe lesson also discusses the importance of asking the right question, pre-building tasks such as data collection and preparation, selecting feature variables, visualizing data, and splitting the dataset. Building a model involves deciding on a training method, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Parameters can be tuned to improve the model's quality. Finally, predictions can be made using new data.\\n\\nAs a challenge, students are encouraged to draw a flow chart reflecting the steps of a machine learning practitioner and reflect on where they are in the process and what they find easy or difficult. There is also a post-lecture quiz to test understanding. Students are recommended to search online for interviews with data scientists to gain insights into their daily work. An assignment is given to interview a data scientist.\"}\n"

       "Introduction to machine learning-The course on classical machine learning for beginners provides an introduction to machine learning. It covers the core concepts of machine learning, the history of ML, ML and fairness, regression ML techniques, classification ML techniques, clustering ML techniques, natural language processing ML techniques, time series forecasting ML techniques, reinforcement learning, and real-world applications for ML. The curriculum does not cover deep learning, neural networks, or AI. Machine learning automates the process of pattern-discovery and has applications in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and weather prediction. Understanding the basics of machine learning is becoming essential across domains due to its widespread adoption."
